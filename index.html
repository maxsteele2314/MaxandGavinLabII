<h1> Lab </h1>    
  
    <p1> In the lab, we learned how to use the console to our advantage to find things out like the mean without using a calculator. 
        This is very useful especially when you have large data sets that would recquire a large amount of work. In the words of Dr. 
        Bradshaw, "computer scientists are lazy", so of course they would want a quick way to find the mean instead, of computing it
        by hand. This is what we did as the students; we learned how to do it a quick way by using javascript. The first problem of
        the lab was already given to us, as we went over it in class. So, the first problem will be the one where you grab the mean 
        of just the first penguin.</p1>
  
    <h2> Problem Number 1</h2>
    <pre>var firstAnswer =  d3.mean(classroom[0].quizes,getGrade)

var answer= firstAnswer; 
</pre>
  
  
    <p1> So in the first one we just wanted the mean for the first penguin alone so we go to the array and we wanted the quizes
        alone. We already had the function to grab the array to get the grades. 
    We also had to use d3.mean for it to give us the mean for the penguin.</p1>
  
    <h2> Problem Number 2</h2>
    <pre>
    var getPenguinMean = function(penguin)
 {
   return d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade)
 }
    
    
var answer= getPenguinMean(classroom[0]);
     </pre>
  
  
    <p1> In the second proble we wanted to find the mean for a given penguin so we had to make a brand new function that would do
        that. In order to do that we had to think of a relevant name, so we called it getPenguinMean and made it a function. We 
        wanted all the objects of penguin quize grades, so we would have it return back to the penguin's grade once we make the 
        function using the one before. This gives us a new function that we called again to see if it worked and it did.
    </p1>
    <h2> Problem 3 </h2>
    <pre>  var fourthAnswer = classroom.map(getPenguinMean) </pre>
  
  
    <p1> In this one, we had to find the mean of all the penguin. So, in order to do that we had to use that map function for it 
        to find every penguin. Since we weren't just working with just one penguin, the map function grabbed all the penguins and
        we ran our function from before to get the mean for all the penguins individually into an array. </p1>
    <h3> Problem 4 </h3>
    <pre> var answer= d3.mean(fourthAnswer);
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> In this one we had to find the mean of all penguins together. The last one found the means of each penguin and put them 
        in an array. So we have to find the mean of the array if gave us. Since we gave it name all we had to do was us d3.mean and 
        put the array name in and it gave us the mean.  </p1>
    
  <h3> Problem 5 </h3>
    <pre> 
            var getPenguinPicture = function(penguin)
 { var obj = {}
   obj.pic = penguin.picture
   return obj
 }
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> 
   In this question we had to return an object from the penguin which included one attribute which was the image. Since
      we were making a penguin object we gave the function a penguin. After this we created an object and left it open
      with the{} brackets. When then gave that object the penguin and gave it a secondary command of the picture so
      that was the attribute  it would return. The last step was to return the object with the attribute of penguin image.
    </p1>
  
   <h3> Problem 6 </h3>
    <pre> 
        var getPenguinQuizMeanPic = function(penguin)
 { var obj = {}
   obj.pic = penguin.picture
   obj.quizMean = d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade)
   return obj
 }
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> 
    This question asked us to expand our last question function and have it include a new attribute of QuizMean. So all the 
      previous function was just copied down and we added a new object. In this object we pushed a d3.mean function to grab
      a penguins quiz scores and find it's mean score. Then to close we still just returned our object containing both 
      attributes in the same object.
    </p1>
  
   <h3> Problem 7 </h3>
    <pre> 
      var getAllPenguinPicQuiz = function(classroom)
    {var obj = {}
     obj.allPic = classroom.map(getPenguinPicture)
     obj.allQuiz = d3.mean(fourthAnswer)
      return obj
    }
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> 
    This question is similiar to the one above but instead of finding the image and quizmean of a given penguin it wants
      those attributes for all the penguins in an object. Since we want all penguins we give our function the classroom
      which includes all the penguins. After this we can take a previous Map of (getPenguinPicture) to return all the
      pictures of all penguins in the classroom. We have also already found the quiz mean for all penguins in the fourth question 
      So we took the d3 mean function, gave it our previous command and just placed it inside our object with images. After
      returning the object we had all images and the Quiz mean for all penguins.
    </p1>
  
   <h3> Problem 8 </h3>
    <pre> 
        var getPenguinInfo = function(penguin)
    {var obj ={}
     obj.pic = penguin.picture
     obj.quiz =  d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade)
     obj.test =  d3.mean(penguin.test,getTest)
     obj.hw = d3.mean(penguin.homework,getHW)
     obj.final = d3.mean(penguin.final,getFinal)
         return obj
    }
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> 
    This question asked for a function that generated a picture, meanQuiz, meanTest, meanHW amd final grade for a given 
      penguin. Since we were back to a given penguin we gave our function a penguin instead of classroom. We now took 
      our bases of previous functions and modified them to grab each specific thing whether that be quiz, hw, etc.. 
      We gave each of these atrributes to our empty object so that when we return our object it will contain all five of 
      these attributes. After the return function it gave us the correct answer.
    </p1>
  
   <h3> Problem 9 </h3>
    <pre> 
     var getPenguinInfoObj = function(penguin)
    {var objp ={}
     obj.pic = penguin.picture
    }
    {var objq = {}    
     obj.quiz =  d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade)
    }
    {var objt = {}
     obj.test =  d3.mean(penguin.test,getTest)
    }
    {var objh = {}
     obj.hw = d3.mean(penguin.homework,getHW)
    }
    {var objf = {}
     obj.final = d3.mean(penguin.final,getFinal)
    }
         return objp, objq, objt, objh, objf
    </pre>
  
  
    <p1> 
    This question is very similiar to the previous but instead of returning all the attributes in the same object 
      it wants objects for each given attribute. We do this by creating empty objects for every attribute needed. 
      After this we take our same fucntions and push them into their given object instead of pilling them all into
      the same one. After this we return all the objects instead of just one. In the end it gives us five objects which
      each attribute which is our correct answer.
